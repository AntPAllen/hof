/* package resources - for working with hof stuff and crds

Resources are a conceptualization around things
and bringing some consistency in how difinitions are written.
They are largely inspired by (copied from) Kubernetes resources and CRDs.

how do we handle CRDs which normally require code changes in hof?
can we use a plugin (pkg/plugin?) to enable this?
maybe the polyglot code runtime(s) can handle this?
