## ideas

write template errors to special file when in watch mode (--watch-errors/E)


### formatting

- go fmt built in
- would love a go version of prettier
- need to run something else for other languages
- run in background, avoid startup costs (dagger does this)
- build a container, config for control, where to find / how to run tools
