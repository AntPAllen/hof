Priorities:

- [ ] datamodel history example
  - [ ] transformation code
	- [ ] server / client versioning support
- [ ] deploy API updates to consumers

- should we focus on tighter integrations with golang?
  - if (for) most users (who) don't care what tech is used?
  - via CUE validation, transformations, hof/flow, custom logic
