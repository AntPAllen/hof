# fmt

a collection of code formatting tools

### todo

- [ ] `hof fmt` for controlling containers & formatting dirs of code
  - [ ] container control, mainly stop all, but start too?

### formatting

- go fmt built in
- would love a go version of prettier
- need to run something else for other languages
- run in background, avoid startup costs (dagger does this)
- build a container, config for control, where to find / how to run tools
